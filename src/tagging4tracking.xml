    Placing Comments
  </title>

  <para>
    We use <command>git blame</command> to track what category of comment has been applied to an author. Since skeleton files and chapters often contain elements committed by a scrum master, course architect, or another author, the placement of review comments is important.  
  </para>

  <para>
    In the past, comments were placed after the closing XML tag for the element in which an error was found. For example&#58;
  </para>

  <screen>
    &#60;para&#62;
    The next step when modifying a style is to set your new style option so that your processor knows what it is. Use the &#60;command&#62;xsltproc&#60;&#47;command&#62; command or use stylesheets.
    &#60;&#47;para&#62;
    &#60;&#33;-- TechEdit: It's not clear how to do this. Suggested: "You can set a parameter dynamically as part of your &#60;command&#62;xsltproc&#60;&#47;command&#62; command, or you can make the change in an additional stylesheet." --&#62;
  </screen>

  <para>
    In this example, the &#60;para&#62; element was entered into the document by the course architect but the text was written by a course developer. The comment therefore appears to be referring to the work of the course architect rather than the course designer. That is incorrect.
  </para>

  <para>
    From now on, comments will now be placed on the line after the error to which it refers&#58;
  </para>

  <screen>
    &#60;para&#62;

    &#60;&#47;para&#62;
  </screen>

  <para>
    In this example, the comment is clearly about the content rather than the XML tag.
  </para>

  <para>
    There may be some exceptions to this rule, including the &#60;title&#62; elements &#40;those are defined by the DCO, so the committer of the title content and the title tag tends to be the same&#41; and the &#60;listitem&#62;, which is embedded deep enough within other tags that they tend to be committed by the same person who wrote the content.

    Responding to Comments

  <para>
    When authors process comments, they are expected to respond to each one.
